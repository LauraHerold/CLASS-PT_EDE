# Combined CLASS-PT and CLASS_EDE

Code used in "New constraint on Early Dark Energy from Planck and BOSS data using the profile likelihood", Laura Herold, Elisa G. M. Ferreira, Eiichiro Komatsu (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12140). This code is based on [CLASS-PT](https://github.com/Michalychforever/CLASS-PT/) and combined with [CLASS_EDE](https://github.com/mwt5345/class_ede), both extensions of [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public). It allows to include non-linear corrections based on perturbation theory as in [Chudaykin et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10607) and early dark energy as in [Hill et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07355). A similar code was already used in [Ivanov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11235).
